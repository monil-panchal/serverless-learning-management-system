## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build cloud plumbing system, where an
application will be designed using serverless technologies to process data (more specifically
large-scale data). This is like building a water plumbing system, which is built once with
plenty of interconnected pieces, and used many times. It does not require any specialist for
the operation. In this project, you will be building a “cloud data plumbing system”, which
could be used by many clients to process their data. You will use different backend services,
and simple front-end application to build the system.
